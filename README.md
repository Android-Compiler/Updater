# Updater
OTA Update Manifest

This directory has been set up in order to service devices with system updates over the air through the use of the built-in Software Update Function.

Security Maintenance Release:

These updates will be delivered over the air only when necessary (Probably every 4 - 6 Months), and they will deliver the latest security patches from Google along with bug fixes where available.

Please note that whilst I will try to support these devices as stated above, I am only one person and therefore cannot provide any gurantees. If you intend to flash my ROMS alongside Open Gapps, I would recommend you use the Pico Variant as this minimises Google Telementry but still provides what is needed to access the play store, so you can download your desired apps.

Also, if you wish to use the OTA Update Function, you MUST flash TWRP Recovery and ensure that Zip File Verification is turned off.
